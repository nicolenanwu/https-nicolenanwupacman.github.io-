Description: 
This project brings up bouncy pacmen that will bounce off the screen boundary.

Here's how the game is played:
When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

Future improvement:
I may add the "eating" feature, to let PacMan eat beans upon collision.
